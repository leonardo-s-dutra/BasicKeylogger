## What a keylogger is

Keylogger is a spyware program made for recording all keyboard interactions. It is usually made to get passwords.
For example, a fake login webpage (phishing) will probably get your data through keyboard typing and send it to the hacker.  

Keyloggers can be made by software (as described), but also by hardware using a USB connection. A malicious drive can be connected
to a machine and save all log to a text file until it is disconnected.
