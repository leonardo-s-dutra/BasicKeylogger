A small demonstration on how a keylogger works using C language

## What a keylogger is

Keylogger is a spyware program made for recording all keyboard interactions. It is usually made to get passwords.
For example, a fake login webpage (phishing) will probably get your data through keyboard typing and send it to the hacker.  

It can be made by software (as described), but also by hardware using USB connection. A malicious drive can be connected
to a machine and save all log to a text file until it is disconnected.  

Despite keyloggers are used for malicious purpose, it also have perfectly legal functionality, for example, parental control for online children, for companies that follow their employees activities and even authors who want to save long written text in multiple ways.
